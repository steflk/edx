Scripts I have written for an EDX course

## Project Description
This repository contains a number of scripts that I have written as part of a Computer Science program via EDX (www.edx.org). The course will not be named as this repository contains solutions for some of the problem sets on this course.

## Usage
This code is for display purposes only. Many of these will not work as stand-alone programs as they rely on other files, however these dependent files were provided as part of the course and were not written by me. For this reason I have not included them in this repository and I have only included code that I have written. The only exception to this is a hash function in dictionary.c that I have provided a reference for.
